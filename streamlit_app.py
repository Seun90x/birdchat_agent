# Note: Make sure to run the indexer script first to create the FAISS index before using this app.
# This app uses the LangChain framework to create a chat interface for querying bird-related information.
# It allows users to ask questions about bird traits, sightings, photos, hotspots, checklists, taxonomy, and more.
# The chat history is maintained in the session state, and the agent processes user queries to provide relevant answers.
# The app is designed to be user-friendly and interactive, allowing users to explore bird-related data easily.
# Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed and the FAISS index is created before running this app.
# The app uses Streamlit for the frontend and LangChain for the backend processing.
# Make sure to set up your environment with the required API keys and database connections for the eBird API and SQLite database.
# The app is structured to handle various bird-related queries and provide accurate responses based on the underlying data.
# It also includes error handling to manage exceptions gracefully and inform users of any issues encountered during processing.
# The chat interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to interact with the agent seamlessly.
# The app can be extended with additional features or improvements based on user feedback and requirements.
# The code is modular, making it easy to maintain and update as needed.
# The app is a great tool for bird enthusiasts, researchers, and anyone interested in bird-related information.
# It leverages the power of AI and natural language processing to provide a rich user experience.
# The app is built with scalability in mind, allowing for future enhancements and additional functionalities.
# The use of FAISS for vector storage enables efficient querying and retrieval of bird-related data.
